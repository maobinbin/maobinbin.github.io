squeue status and reason codes

The squeue command details a variety of information on an active job’s status including reasons why a job has a particular status. The following tables outline a variety of job state and reason codes you may encounter when using squeue to check on your jobs. Job state codes describe a job’s current state in queue (e.g. pending, completed). Job reason codes describe the reason why the job is in its current state.
Job State Codes
Status 	Code 	Explaination
COMPLETED 	CD 	The job has completed successfully.
COMPLETING 	CG 	The job is finishing but some processes are still active.
FAILED 	F 	The job terminated with a non-zero exit code and failed to execute.
PENDING 	PD 	The job is waiting for resource allocation. It will eventually run.
PREEMPTED 	PR 	The job was terminated because of preemption by another job.
RUNNING 	R 	The job currently is allocated to a node and is running.
SUSPENDED 	S 	A running job has been stopped with its cores released to other jobs.
STOPPED 	ST 	A running job has been stopped with its cores retained.

A full list of these Job State codes can be found in Slurm’s documentation.
Job Reason Codes
Reason Code 	Explaination
Priority 	One or more higher priority jobs is in queue for running. Your job will eventually run.
Dependency 	This job is waiting for a dependent job to complete and will run afterwards.
Resources 	The job is waiting for resources to become available and will eventually run.
InvalidAccount 	The job’s account is invalid. Cancel the job and resubmit with correct account.
InvaldQoS 	The job’s QoS is invalid. Cancel the job and resubmit with correct account.
QOSGrpCpuLimit 	All CPUs assigned to your job’s specified QoS are in use; job will run eventually.
QOSGrpMaxJobsLimit 	Maximum number of jobs for your job’s QoS have been met; job will run eventually.
QOSGrpNodeLimit 	All nodes assigned to your job’s specified QoS are in use; job will run eventually.
PartitionCpuLimit 	All CPUs assigned to your job’s specified partition are in use; job will run eventually.
PartitionMaxJobsLimit 	Maximum number of jobs for your job’s partition have been met; job will run eventually.
PartitionNodeLimit 	All nodes assigned to your job’s specified partition are in use; job will run eventually.
AssociationCpuLimit 	All CPUs assigned to your job’s specified association are in use; job will run eventually.
AssociationMaxJobsLimit 	Maximum number of jobs for your job’s association have been met; job will run eventually.
AssociationNodeLimit 	All nodes assigned to your job’s specified association are in use; job will run eventually.
